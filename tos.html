        <h2>Terms of Service</h2>
        <p>Welcome to the Terms of Service for DeputyDevSolutions, a bot created and managed by DeputyMods. By using DeputyDevSolutions in your Discord server, you agree to the following terms.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="content">

        <h3>1. Service Overview</h3>
        <p>DeputyDevSolutions is a Discord bot designed to enforce community guidelines by banning members who have violated Discord's or your serverâ€™s Terms of Service (TOS). The bot's primary feature is to maintain a database of banned members to enhance server security.</p>

        <h3>2. User Responsibilities</h3>
        <p>Users who add DeputyDevSolutions to their Discord servers agree to use it responsibly. Misuse of the bot, including the inappropriate banning of members without just cause, may result in removal of the bot from the server and denial of future access.</p>

        <h3>3. Data Collection and Usage</h3>
        <p>DeputyDevSolutions records information on banned users in its secure database to maintain accurate records and assist in future ban assessments across servers that use the bot. All data is handled in compliance with privacy standards. For information on data removal requests, please contact DeputyMods via <a href="https://discord.gg/n7Xr5snRRm" target="_blank">our Discord server</a>.</p>

        <h3>4. Ban Database</h3>
        <p>By adding DeputyDevSolutions to your server, you consent to sharing ban information with our database. This information may be used in other servers to identify and remove users who have violated TOS elsewhere, enhancing community-wide security. DeputyMods does not share, sell, or publicly disclose this data beyond its intended use in supported servers.</p>

        <h3>5. Limitations of Liability</h3>
        <p>DeputyMods is not liable for any unintended or improper bans performed by DeputyDevSolutions. Server administrators are responsible for overseeing bot use in compliance with server rules and Discord's Community Guidelines. We encourage reporting any bugs or misuse via <a href="https://discord.gg/n7Xr5snRRm" target="_blank">our support Discord server</a>.</p>

        <h3>6. Changes to the TOS</h3>
        <p>DeputyMods reserves the right to update these Terms of Service at any time. Updates will be posted here and take effect immediately. Continued use of DeputyDevSolutions constitutes acceptance of any modified terms.</p>
